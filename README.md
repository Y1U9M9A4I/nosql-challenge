For food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, I've been delegated to analyze ratings data in order to aid teir journalists and food critics in deciding where to focus future articles.

Firstly, using Mongo, I began by setting up both the database and jupyter notebook. New restaurant (Penang Flavours" data was updated into the database. We filled in missing data for this restaurant (Business ID). 

In order to better decide which places to avoid and which to visit, we also performed exploratory analysis into this dataset, setting parameters of interest such as overall rating and hygiene. 

In this assignment, Mongo, Python and Jupyter notebook was utilized.
